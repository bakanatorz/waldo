Executables:

    waldo_server

        Basic API:
        Syntax: server/request/[trackid]/[filename]
        The filename is an optional argument to allow the client to specify the name of the download file
        Request should be one of the following verbs:
            monitor
                Doesn't take a trackid, returns a JSON array of currently-downloading track ID's to track info and completion fraction
            init
                Takes a trackid, returns a JSON object with a response variable of value:
                "invalid" - an invalid trackid was supplied
                "complete" - the track is currently downloaded and ready to server
                "progressing" - the track is currently being downloaded
                "starting" - the download of the track has begun
                Also provides track info (title, artist, album, length, year) for a valid trackid
            forceinit
                The same as init, but forces a redownload of the file instead of serving from cache
            check
                Takes a trackid, returns a JSON object with a response variable of value:
                "invalid" - an invalid trackid was supplied
                "complete" - the track is currently downloaded and ready to server
                "progressing" - the track is currently being downloaded
                Decimal value representing the approximate fraction completed (can be greater than 1 due to inaccurate estimations)
                Also provides track info (title, artist, album, length, year) for a valid trackid
            get
                Takes a trackid, returns the file if it is ready for download, otherwise 404
