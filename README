        Where request is one of the following verbs:
            monitor
                Doesn't take a trackid, returns a JSON array of currently-downloading track ID's to completion fraction
            init
                Takes a trackid, returns a JSON object with a response variable of value:
                "invalid" - an invalid trackid was supplied
                "complete" - the track is currently downloaded and ready to server
                "progressing" - the track is currently being downloaded
                "starting" - the download of the track has begun
            check
                Takes a trackid, returns a JSON object with a response variable of value:
                "invalid" - an invalid trackid was supplied
                "complete" - the track is currently downloaded and ready to server
                "progressing" - the track is currently being downloaded
                Decimal value representing the approximate fraction completed (can be greater than 1 due to inaccurate estimations)
            get
                Takes a trackid, returns the file if it is ready for download, otherwise 404
